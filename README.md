# UT-at-Austin-Hackathon
### Background
A non-banking financial company (NBFC) is a financial institution that provides bank-like financial services without holding a full banking license or being regulated by national or international banking authorities. NBFCs offer investment, risk pooling, contractual savings, and market brokering services.

DHDL Ltd. (name changed), an NBFC in India, has faced profitability challenges due to rising loan defaults. The company seeks to identify and evaluate the relative importance of various parameters contributing to loan defaults.

### Objective
This hackathon aims to identify the key parameters that determine whether a client will default on a loan, using data from over 90,000 clients who have previously taken loans from the company.
